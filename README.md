# Airbnb-Booking-Analysis
## Introduction
Since its founding, Airbnb has hosted over 60 million people in 34,000 cities across the world and is continuing to grow quickly. Airbnb provides a convenient source of income for people who have otherwise vacant space and for guests looking for affordable and convenient housing options. With any service, trying to monitor and understand the underlying pricing dynamics of the Airbnb market is very important both for hosts and guests. As users continue to grow on both the supply and demand side, homeowners may find it hard to properly price their property. Airbnb has recognized this and conducted considerable research into suggesting pricing from a supply side standpoint.

## Summary 
Data analysis on thousands of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. Our main objective is to find out the key metrics that influence the listing of properties on the platform. For this, we will explore and visualize the dataset from Airbnb in NYC using basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. We have found out the distribution of every Airbnb listing based on their location, including their price range, room type, listing name, and other related factors. We have analyzed this dataset from different angles and have come up with interesting insights. This can help in making strategic data-driven decisions by the marketing team, finance team and technical team of Airbnb.

## Project Motivation
This project analyzes NYC Airbnb data to explore the differences in price and availability among different area groups in NYC, to identify the busiest hosts in NYC.

## Area Differences
Mahattan and Brooklyn are two areas that are the most popular among the five boroughs in NYC. Within these two areas, private room and entire room/apartment are the most popular room types. Mahattan has the greatest listing price among the five boroughs in all three room types.

## The Most busiset Hosts
In my analysis, I calculate the number of listing for each host in NYC.The majority of these most successful hosts have listed their rooms in Manhattan and Brooklyn as entire home/apartment

## Conclusion
* All the neighbourhood groups, 'Share room' is the room type that gets most traffic.
* Because it is to most cheapest room type available in all properties. 
* If we calculate with respect to neighbourhood we can see that only two of the top 15 locations have listing for shared room, Arverne neighbourhood in Queens with 'Share room' roomtype as the highest.
* Overall Arverne, staten island  has the highest traffic.
* The most busiest host is michael.Because he is listed more 414 times.
* We can conclude that throughout NewYork city there is a larger preference towards Entire apt as compared to private or shared rooms irrespective to the prices hence the Traffic there are most and busiest host is 'michael'
